What?
We will develop a program that makes the car dance in tempo with music

Why?
Because it's guaranteed to be fun

How?
Make a coreography for the car to move and blink in sync with the tempo of a song, ideally find a way extract the 
tempos of any given song, and have the car dance all night long, then send it off to a festival.
