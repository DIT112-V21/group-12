What?

We will develop a program that makes the car dance in tempo with music. We will make a catalog of moves and choreography that the car will use randomly
to the beat and the car will change the speed based of the rythm.

We will create a UI where you can upload a music file and choose dance moves and the program will combine them into a choreography and make the car dance to 
your song of choice.

Why?

Because it's guaranteed to be fun and furthermore we'll gain some insight into the challenges of programming something that is to be performed accurately with
regards to physical time, which as a concept could have applications in real world physical systems. 

How?

Make a catalog of dance moves for the car to move and blink in sync with the tempo of a song, and make the timing of the execution of the moves be dependent on
the tempo of any given song as an input variable. The program will extract the tempos of any given song, and have the car dance all night long, then send it off
to a COVID-free music festival.
